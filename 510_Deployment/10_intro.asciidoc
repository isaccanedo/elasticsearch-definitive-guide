If you have made it this far in the book, hopefully you've learned a thing or
two about Elasticsearch and are ready to deploy your cluster to production. This
chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to running your cluster in
production, but it covers the key things to consider before putting your cluster
live.

Three main areas are covered:

- Logistical considerations, such as hardware recommendations and deployment
strategies
- Configuration changes that are more suited to a production environment
- Post-deployment considerations, such as security, maximizing indexing
performance, and backups
