== Geo Aggregations

Although filtering or scoring results by geolocation is useful,((("geo-aggregations")))((("aggregations", "geo"))) it is often more
useful to be able to present information to the user on a map. A search may
return way too many results to be able to display each geo-point individually,
but geo-aggregations can be used to cluster geo-points into more manageable
buckets.

Three aggregations work with fields of type `geo_point`:

<<geo-distance-agg,`geo_distance`>>::

    Groups documents into concentric circles around a central point.

<<geohash-grid-agg,`geohash_grid`>>::

    Groups documents by geohash cell, for display on a map.

<<geo-bounds-agg,`geo_bounds`>>::

    Returns the `lat/lon` coordinates of a bounding box that would
    encompass all of the geo-points. This is useful for choosing
    the correct zoom level when displaying a map.
