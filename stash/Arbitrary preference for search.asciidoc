Arbitrary string::

The `preference` parameter can be set to any arbitrary string, such as the
session ID of a user, which would ensure that the user always gets results
from the same node.  While this is less useful when retrieving individual
documents, it can be very useful when searching: two documents that are ranked
as equally relevant by a search query may be returned in a different order by
different shards. Always returning results from the same shard means that the
user will see the results in a consistent order.
