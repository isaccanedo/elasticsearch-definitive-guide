==== Metadata: Document Identity

There are four metadata fields ((("metadata, document", "identity")))associated with document identity:

`_id`::
   The string ID of the document

`_type`::
   The type name of the document

`_index`::
   The index where the document lives

`_uid`::
   The `_type` and `_id` concatenated together as `type#id`

By default, the `_uid` field is((("id field"))) stored (can be retrieved) and
indexed (searchable).  The `_type` field((("type field")))((("index field")))((("uid field"))) is indexed but not stored,
and the `_id` and `_index` fields are neither indexed nor stored, meaning
they don't really exist.

In spite of this, you can query the `_id` field as though it were a real
field.  Elasticsearch uses the `_uid` field to derive the `_id`. Although you
can change the `index` and `store` settings for these fields, you almost
never need to do so.
